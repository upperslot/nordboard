How to Run:
Save as nordboard.py
Open terminal and run: python nordboard.py

Play as Red (Denmark) — choose which piece to move when prompted.
Computer (Blue/Sweden) will play intelligently — knocking you back, sneaking up, and racing to win.

Requested, not implemented, features:
- Possibility to choose between playing Red (Denmark) and Blue (Sweden). Currently the human plays only Red.
- Further enhanced logic for the computer player.
